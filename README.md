# Typing-Test WebApp
                                                

 A simple online Typing Test web application that displays the player's typing speed in words per minute as well as typing accuracy. The project was created entirely with HTML, CSS, and javascript, without the usage of any javascript libraries or frameworks. Typing Test layout was inpired from 10fastfingers.com. It was my very first web development project :)Â

## Some resources and basic advice on how to improve your typing speed

 -   To type, try to utilise all 10 fingers. To write quickly, master the QWERTY ten-finger method. 
 -   If you use QWERTY approach for 15 minutes every day for at least a month, your typing speed will definitely increase upto 50 words per minute.

  ## Authors experience of Speed Typing    

  As of the day I'm writing this Readme file (9 July 2021), my maximum typing speed on monkeytype.com is 123 WPM, and my average typing speed is around 105 WPM.
  
  ### QWERY learning phase 
 
  I started with 22 WPM in October 2020 and spent 15 days studying QWERTY, which quickly increased my speed to 35 WPM.

  ### Practice-Practice-Practice-phase

  There is no other phase of the learning curve for speed typing; it is just practise. So, from 35WPM to current Best, the only difference is Practice; after 15 days of learning QWERTYÂ there is no new method to learn.
