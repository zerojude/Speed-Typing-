# Typing-Test WebApp
                                                

 A simple online Typing Test web application that displays the player's typing speed in words per minute as well as typing accuracy. The project was created entirely with HTML, CSS, and javascript, without the usage of any javascript libraries or frameworks. Typing Test layout was inpired from 10fastfingers.com. It was my very first web development project :)Â

## Some resources and basic advice on how to improve your typing speed

 -   To type, try to utilise all 10 fingers. 
 -   To write quickly, master the QWERTY ten-finger method. 
 -   If you use QWERTY approach for 15 minutes every day for at least a month, your typing speed will definitely increase upto 50 words per minute.
